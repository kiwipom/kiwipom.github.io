##2015

This year's running challenge is to complete half a dozen half-marathons, and to get to 1500 kms for the year. I think it's acheivable - we'll see how it goes.

I've already picked out the halfs, and I've signed up for Albany Lakes again. I'll try not to get confused and miss the 3rd race this year....


Here's my progress for the year: [Smashrun](http://smashrun.com/ian.randall/overview/2015)
