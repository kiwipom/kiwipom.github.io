##2015

<strike>This year's running challenge is to complete half a dozen half-marathons, and to get to 1500 kms for the year. I think it's acheivable - we'll see how it goes.</strike>

OK. Time to get serious. I've decided to enter the (full) Auckland Marathon in November, which means that I will smash through the "6 half marathons" goal. Including training runs, that number will be closer to twenty by the end of the year.

I'm a little down on the 1,500kms target; but between now (mid-July) and November I expect to be putting in some serious training miles. Will be interesting to see what that number ends up being... I wonder if it will get closer to 2kk? Probably not, but maybe that's a goal for next year?
