###Gather
I'm looking forward to [Gather](http://gathergather.co.nz/) in July. I've put my hand up to do a node.js talk/discussion so that should be fun. There're always amazing people at Gather talking about amazing things. Should be a blast.


###DDD Melbourne

[DDD Melbourne](http://www.dddmelbourne.com/) is happening again this year. I was lucky enough to get over to it a couple of years ago and talk about XAML frameworks. LOL we were such dorks backs then.

Whilst I'm not going to be able to get across this year, it's a cool event and if you are able to get there I would highly recommend it. There'll be a good mix of very good speakers on all kinds of topics. I found the event to be a bit MS-focussed but it's really down to you to submit a non-MS talk if you want to change that ;-)

It's also basically free (just a nominal fee to help cover the costs).

So, yeah. Submit a session, or just wait for tickets to go on sale. Recommended!


###Tech-Ed
I've put my hands up for a couple of talks at [Tech-Ed NZ](https://newzealand.msteched.com/) this year, hoping for my 4th year in a row as a speaker. Interestingly, this is the first year I haven't submitted a XAML talk, but I'm sure my friends at [Marker Metro](http://markermetro.com) will be proudly flying the XAML flags high :-) I'm keeping my fingers crossed and if selected I'll let you knowâ€¦


###The Warriors
No, but seriously? What the ***arse*** is going on there?
