### Software gardeners

Have you read [this](http://www.chrisaitchison.com/2011/05/03/you-are-not-a-software-engineer/)? you should, it's excellent. It's two and a half years old now, but it remains relevant, and by and large I agree with it.

If you didn't click the link, here's the **tl;dr** version: The building analogy doesn't fit the software industry, we're more like gardeners: The soil we plant on is entirely different every time, and if we don't constantly tend our gardens they get overgrown with weeds...

Someone I like and respect very much pointed out that the article neglects the masses of repeatability and shared knowledge in software dev. I agree to an extent, although I think that leads to another discussion about how much of that knowledge gets shared and actually applied across companies, across teams, hell - across projects within a team!

So then, someone else I like and respect^ very much commented 

> "We're good at skyscrapers because we've been doing them for a hundred years. We suck at software."

So by extension, then, I assume they are saying that we haven't been doing software for a hundred years yet, and we haven't quite worked out what we're doing, so we suck at it.

On this much, I agree: As an industry, software can do *fuckloads* better. But we've actually been playing this game for a few decades now, so the 'hundreds of years' argument doesn't hold any water I'm afraid.

No. Here's why the building analogy doesn't hold up (in addition to the points made in the original article)

##### Point 1.
If you order a skyscraper, you pay a company to produce detailed blueprints and you closely inspect 3d visualisations of the building. You pretty much know *exactly* what you are going to get before a single spadeful of soil gets dug up for foundations.

How many software projects have you worked on like that? I can't think of too many in my career. "We haven't quite worked out what that bit's going to look like, but you can just start over here whilst we're working it out" is a much more common philosophy, sadly...

##### Point 2.
If you are paying a company to build a skyscraper, having approved the designs, with half the floors already built, you know that you can't change your mind about the square footage of the floorspace, or the shape of the kitchen or where the lifts should be. 

This is the blessing and curse of software. We can rip down the whole skyscraper, shuffle the plans around and build it again in the time it takes to push to TeamCity. But just because we *can*, it doesn't mean we really should.


##### Point 3.
I'm stealing this one from the article. When you run a construction project there is a clear end-goal. Cut the ribbon, open the building, call it done.

Yes, in a service-delivery company, you can deliver a piece of software to a company, send them a bill and call it done, but that fundamentally isn't how software works. Software products evolve, and by-and-large, they atrophy. Something is always changing - a browser version, an OS update, something on the platform. And with every update, the risk of breaking changes rises just a little bit. We must constantly tend to our code-base, refactoring here, cleaning up there. It's never really done any more than a garden is...

##### So yes
Our software products are our gardens, and we must tend to them with love.

The building analogy will become relevant again when we build bridges and skyscrapers with Kanban...





^ it's not important who, because this chap is *amazing* and by and large I share opinions with him. This article is not about personality...
