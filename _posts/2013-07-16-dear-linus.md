I thought I'd better write you because you appear to have missed something *really* important.

That bit where you were building amazing software, and blazing a trail (along with Stallman and GNU et al) for open-source? That was wonderful. So wonderful in fact, that the whole world took note.

And when you had the attention of the whole world, you had this marvelous oportunity to show people the very best of being a software developer - and what did you do?

[You were rude](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/13/132). [I mean really unneccesarily rude](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/2/21/225)

You showed people that in order to be successful, you have to be a jerk. That public humiliation of people is the best way to lead them. You must have realised that people would be looking to you for inspiration; that you are a role model to hundreds of thousands - millions even - of fellow geeks?

Well sorry old chap, but as a role model, you have some work to do. Because here's the secret sauce: You can create great things - and get the very best out of hard-working colleagues and team-members - by being civil, warm and encouraging. By forgiving mistakes and by separating a piece of code you dislike emotionally from the person who contributed it.

It's OK to say "We need to discuss this pull request because I don't like the direction it would take [feature X]", but it's not OK to call the person who contributed it "fucking moronic". I'm surprised someone as bright as you hasn't worked that out yet, frankly.




Anyway. Hugs and kisses,

Ian, xx
