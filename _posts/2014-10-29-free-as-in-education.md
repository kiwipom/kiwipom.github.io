title: Free as in Education

###How much would you pay for a night out?

- Dinner for 2. Couple of drinks and a taxi home. Couple of hundred dollars?
- Movie night - 2 tickets to a blockbuster and share a box of popcorn. $50?
- How about the cheap option: Rent a DVD from the shop. Maybe dial a pizza. Call it $20.

_So how much would you pay for a couple of hours at a software meetup?_

If your answer is "Nothing! I expect Corporate Sponsor Inc to cover the costs of running the group" then you are Doing It Wrong.

Historically, many software groups have been exactly that: Free. Free as in beer, and Free as in fully funded by some sponsor or other. The problem is that free is a terrible precedent that we have set ourselves, and here's why:

- If signing up is free, then it's too easy, even if you're not sure you can make it. Having a small barrier to entry (like a low $10 or $15 fee) means only people who really want to come will sign up.
- There is intrinsic value in meeting like-minded technologists, and truly *belonging* in a community. Making the meetings free strips away that value.
- You get to learn amazing new things, and have a few laughs along the way. How much is that worth? Nothing? Seriously?
- Volunteers put time and effort into coordinating the meetings. By insisting that meetings are free, you're telling them their time is valueless and that's just rude.
- Just putting a bit of food and drink in front of everyone is a reasonable challenge with just $10 a head to play with. For that kind of budget, you aren't going to get much better than beer or pizza, sadly...


Frankly, if you can't see ***at least*** $15 of instrinsic value in spending 2 hours chatting and learning, then community probably isn't right for you. Can I recommend a quiet night in and a slice of lightly buttered toast? Or margarine. Maybe you should stick to margarine. It's cheaper.
