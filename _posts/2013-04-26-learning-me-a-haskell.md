title: Learning me a haskell for great good

Codemania was wonderful. Sure I was bound to say that: I'm biased; but it truly was. A personal highlight for me was [this amazing talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlZCiiKGbb0) by [Katie Miller](http://codemiller.com).

Now, I'm a C# dev through and through. I started writing VB and C++ for Windows way back in the day, and have been a Microsoft dev ever since. But when Katie showed us a slide of Haskell code and **3 corresponding slides of Java** I figured there must be something in it.

So. Functional Programming is the shizzle, it seems. But where to start? The googles quickly told me I should be [learning me a haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and who am I to argue?

I hadn't planned on blogging about it, but [Ivan insisted](https://twitter.com/ppog_penguin/status/327369703473426432) so I think I have to.


Watch this space.
