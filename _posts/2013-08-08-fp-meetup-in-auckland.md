A while ago, I wondered whether there was a functional programming meetup in Auckland, because if I'm going to actually try to learn more about FP and FP languages - rather than just watching the new seasons of  Dexter and Breaking Bad - then it would be great to hook up with some folks who actually know the topic and are happy to share.

I was delighted, shortly after, to see that [Kalman](http://twitter.com/kalmanb) started Auckland's very own FP [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/). The first meeting was this week and I have to say that the group appears to be a good 'un.

There was a good amount of food and drink (generously hosted by Movio), a good presentation on composition and an appropriate amount of heckling and trolling from the audience. Special shout-out to the guy that said C# lambdas are fugly. As [@kev_nz](http://twitter.com/kev_nz) mentioned at the time: "da-fuq?"

But - not withstanding the anorak element - the debate was healthy and the topic was fascinating.

I'm already looking forward to the next meeting. Maybe see some of you there?
