# Ramblings. Funtimes. Software.

### About the author:
I've written code since the late 80's and professionally since 1997. A one-time XAML geek I currently work for [Spendvision](http://spendvision.com) as a C# / asp.net developer for our SaaS platform. 

I helped create [Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz) with m'buddy [Ben](http://ben.geek.nz). I'm constantly staggered that amazing people come to hear other amazing people talk about software every year. You guys are great.

I do like the [twitters](http://twitter.com/kiwipom) but it's best to mute me at the weekend if you're not that into `#sportsball`.
