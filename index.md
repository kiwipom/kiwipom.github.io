# Ramblings. Funtimes. Software.

### About the author:
I've written code since the late 80's and professionally since 1997. By day I write C#, HTML, JavaScript and even a little SQL for [Pushpay](http://pushpay.com).

In the evening, when not plotting and planning for [Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz)<superscript>*</superscript> I'm learning more about Functional Programming - especially Haskell and F#. Speaking of which - I run the [Auckland F# meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-F-Programming-Meetup/).

I do like the [twitters](http://twitter.com/kiwipom) but it's best to mute me at the weekend if you're not that into `#sportsball`.


<p><superscript>*</superscript>2015 was a massive success. The plottings for making 2016 _Bigger And Better Than Ever_ is underway!</p>
